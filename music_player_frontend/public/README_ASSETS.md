# Public Assets for Ocean Player

This app uses mock audio URLs referenced as `/sample-audio/trackX.mp3`. 
If you want to hear sound locally, add small mp3 samples into:

- public/sample-audio/track1.mp3
- public/sample-audio/track2.mp3
- public/sample-audio/track3.mp3
- public/sample-audio/track4.mp3
- public/sample-audio/track5.mp3

Otherwise, the UI and controls will still function without audio playback.
